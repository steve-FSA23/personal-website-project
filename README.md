#Simple Resume
Use pair programming to complete the following tasks: 

Decide which partner is going to be the driver and which is the navigator. 
Have the driver open their IDE and create a file named resume.html.
The driver should use HTML to create a simple resume, while the navigator assists.
NOTE: A simple resume might consist of a large heading (containing your name), several smaller headings for different categories of experience, and bullet points describing highlights from that experience. You do not have to use real text for this exercise -- you can use Lorem Ipsum!
